We will revisit the 2ndassignment, except with a slider to transition between the two images gradually. Your app should display an image view with a slider below it. There should be a label “AU” to the left of the slider and “UA” to the right of the slider. When the slider is all the way to the left, the AU logo should show in the image view. As the slider moves to the right, the AU logo should fade and an Alabama logo should come into view. At the halfway point, both logos should be visible (alpha = 0.5 for both image), superimposed one on top of the other. As the slider goes all the way to the right, the AU image should vanish and the UA image should be the only one visible.
